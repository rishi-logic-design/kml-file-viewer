## Component Breakdown

### 1. **FileUpload.jsx**

- Uses **Material UI** for file upload button.
- Reads and converts `.kml` files to **GeoJSON** using `@tmcw/togeojson`.
- Passes the converted GeoJSON data to the parent component.

### 2. **MapView\.jsx**

- Uses **React-Leaflet** to render an interactive map.
- Dynamically updates based on uploaded **GeoJSON** data.
- Automatically fits map bounds to the uploaded features.

### 3. **Summary.jsx**

- Counts different feature types (**Point, LineString, Polygon, etc.**).
- Displays the summary in a tabular format.

### 4. **Detailed.jsx**

- Filters and calculates the **length** of `LineString` and `MultiLineString` features using **Turf.js**.
- Displays results in a table format.

### 5. **App.jsx**

- Manages application state using **useState**.
- Handles file upload and passes data to child components.
- Renders the **MapView**, **Summary**, and **Detailed** components.
